// Package opt defines types for working with opt values, inspired by Java's `Optional` class.
// An opt value either contains a value of a certain type (Some), or it is empty (None).
// This package provides a way to safely handle such values without the risk of null ptr dereferences.
// It includes functions for creating opt values, checking if they are present, and retrieving the value if it is present.
